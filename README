if desired:

– luatexbase-compat: compatibility helpers;
– luatexbase-loader: Lua module loading;
– luatexbase-regs: allocation of registers and the like;
– luatexbase-attr: attribute allocation;
– luatexbase-cctb: catcode table allocation;
– luatexbase-modutils: Lua module declaration; and
- luatexbase-mcb: callbacks extensions.

Installation
------------

Here are the recommended installation methods (preferred first).

1. If you are using TeX Live 2010 or later, use 'tlmgr install luatexbase'.
If your are using MiKTeX, use the MiKTeX Package Manager.
Alternatively, try you Linux distribution's package management system.

2. a. Grab luatexbase.tds.zip on the CTAN.
   b. Unzip it at the root of one or your TDS trees.
   c. You may need to update some filename database after this, see your TeX
      distribution's manual for details. (Hint: with TeX Live, run 'mktexlsr';
      with MikTeX, look for "Refresh FNDB" in the MikTeX menu.)

3. a. Grab the sources from CTAN or github.
   b. Run 'make install TEXMFROOT=/path/to/texmf'.
      (Warning: 'make install' without giving a TEXMFROOT will
       put files in './texmf', which is probably not what you want.)
   c. See 2c.

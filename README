                          The luatexbase generic bundle


luatexbase provides basic resource management, similar to the way TeX
resources are handled by Plain TeX and LaTeX, for new resources introduced by
LuaTeX.

Each resource is handled in a separate package.

The resources considered are:
- registers (\count, \box, etc.)    -> luatexbase-regs
- Lua module loading                -> luatexbase-loader
- \attribute's                      -> luatexbase-attr
- \catcodetable's                   -> luatexbase-cctb
- Lua callbacks                     -> luamcallbacks

Additional convenience packages:
- Lua module declaration            -> luatexbase-modutils
- compatibility helpers             -> luatexbase-compat

WARNING: these packages are subject to change or even be merged or disappear in
the near future!

Installation
------------

Here are the recommended installation methods (preferred first).
(Methods "commented out" are not available right now.)

% 1. If you are using TeX Live 2009 or later, use 'tlmgr install luatexbase'.
% Alternatively, try your (TeX or Linux) distribution's package management system.
% 
% 2. a. Grab luatextra.tds.zip on the CTAN.
%    b. Unzip it at the root of one or your TDS trees.
%    c. You may need to update some filename database after this, see your TeX
% distribution's manual for details.

3. a. Grab the sources from CTAN or github.
   b. Run 'make install TEXMFROOT=/path/to/texmf'.
   c. See 2c.

4. Try to figure it out by looking at the Makefile and comments in the sources.

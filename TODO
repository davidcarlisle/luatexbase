general
-------

- check for user macros starting with \luatex
- problems for testing since the loader changed. review Makefile

------

- \luadirect abstraction to \directlua
- \EnsureLuaTeXPrimitive

- write doc
- make a real test using a fake texmf tree as TEXMFHOME?
- ensure compatibility with older versions of LuaTeX (no 'lua' type for
  kpse.find_file).

modutils

Review extensively.
- names starting with \luatex
- logic (see what LaTeX2e does)

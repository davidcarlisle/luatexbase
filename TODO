general
-------

- write test files
- change prefix for internal TeX macros
- check for lua name conflicts ('module' used in mods)
- check for macros starting with \luatex
- make TeX tests cleaner: \begingroup\expandafter\ETC.
- reload check, declaration, luatex test, catcodes for plain
- import/update doc
- date & changes entry

- redo module loading in packages once mods is done.
- adjust preamble to avoid duplicated list of files (refer to DTX instead)

Later
=====

- change lua module name(s) (luatexbase or luatexbase.regs etc)

regs
----

- Should the various allocation macros set something in a Lua table, or should
  we just wait for it to be implemented in LuaTeX? (The \*blk macros would be
rather tricky in this respect, but are they really used?) Well, is there any
actual need for this?

attr
---

- don't write in the tex table!

cctb
----

- don't write in the tex table!
- don't define macros starting with \luatex

general
-------

- add catcode defenses
- adjust original luatextra package

Later
=====

- check for user macros starting with \luatex
- change lua module name(s) (luatexbase or luatexbase.regs etc)
- compat with LuaTeX 0.25.4? (Means problems with \directlua, primitive names,
  kpse.find_file(..., 'lua'), etc.) Maybe do a compat package?

regs
----

- Should the various allocation macros set something in a Lua table, or should
  we just wait for it to be implemented in LuaTeX? (The \*blk macros would be
rather tricky in this respect, but are they really used?) Well, is there any
actual need for this?

attr
----

- don't write in the tex table!

cctb
----

- don't write in the tex table!
- don't define macros starting with \luatex

loader
------

- a.b.c -> a/b/c or a/b.c or a.b.c? What do to with files under texmf/scripts?
- adujst names of the modules afterwards
- write doc

modutils
--------

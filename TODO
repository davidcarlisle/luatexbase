general
-------

- change prefix for internal TeX macros
- check for lua name conflicts ('module' used in mods)
- check for macros starting with \luatex
- write test files
- reload check, declaration, luatex test
- handle catcodes for Plain (more comprensive defenses to be added later)
- import/update doc
- make TeX tests cleaner: \begingroup\expandafter\ETC.


Later
=====

- change lua module name(s) (luatexbase or luatexbase.regs etc)

regs
----

- Should the various allocation macros set something in a Lua table, or should
  we just wait for it to be implemented in LuaTeX? (The \*blk macros would be
rather tricky in this respect, but are they really used?)

attr
---

- don't write in the tex table!
